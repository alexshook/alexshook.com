My first code blog was built on Octopress 2. It was a great starter blog, but I've been wanting to make some changes for a while. I got tired of waiting for Octopress 3, so I'm relaunching with [Hugo](http://gohugo.io/), which looks like it has an active community and some great documentation. 

I had planned on migrating my posts, but decided on a fresh start instead. 

Hello, world.
