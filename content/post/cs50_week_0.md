Recently I've had a bunch of time for side projects so I thought I'd take a computer science class. I was looking for a fairly rigorous one and didn't mind picking up some other languages. Harvard's CS50 at edX has great reviews, so that's the one I started.

Our first assignment was to build something in Scratch, which I have never used before. It was a bit cumbersome because I've never programmed in a language like Scratch before. At first, I had a hard time thinking of what to make, but luckily I had an epiphany one night on Twitter. 

I ended up building a game called [The Floor is Lava](https://scratch.mit.edu/studios/3678335/) :D. I can't even remember the last time I made a game. It was a lot of fun. It seems like I made it a little too easy to play, though, so I'd like to add a lava monster and maybe the concept of lives, like if you step in the lava three times it's game over.
