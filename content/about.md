Hello! I’m Alex. I write code. Mostly Ruby, JavaScript when I need something fancy in a browser. ClojureScript for fun and profit. This blog uses Hugo and I keep meaning to make more than a terminal app in Go. 

I’ve been writing code ever since I turned eleven and an owl didn’t deliver my Hogwarts letter. I never got a toad ~~and a phoenix feather wand~~ (Pottermore says it's apple/phoenix feather), but creating with code is close to magical.  Still planning on a trip to the wizarding world at Universal Studios, though.

Sometimes I [tweet](https://twitter.com/alexshook). Generally better at [photos](https://www.instagram.com/alexshook/). Varied interests: fashion, food, New York, SAD lamps, Eggs Benedict, aloe plants. Fan of coffee and Wednesday Addams.
